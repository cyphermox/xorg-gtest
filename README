X.Org dummy testing environment for Google Test
===============================================

Provides a Google Test environment for starting and stopping
a dummy X server for headless testing purposes. The actual 
environment is defined in header environment.h. Please refer to
the Google test documentation for information on how to add a custom 
environment.

Moreover, a custom main()-function that takes care of setting up the 
environment is provided in libxtestingenvironment_main.a. This library can be
used as a replacement for libgtest_main.a
